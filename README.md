# Exploratory Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects. The main goal is to get familiarized with the basics of data analysis and create a strong base for my Machine Learning journey.

Each project involves exploring a dataset to understand its main characteristics, find patterns, visualize relationships, and test hypotheses.
